# CRUD API

will not have a database connection.

Uses functions to perform operations on the data sent.

Will have 5 routes:

- Get all
- get by id
- create
- update
- delete

each route has a corresponding function in the go package.

There will only be two endpoints, and we'll test these using postman.
